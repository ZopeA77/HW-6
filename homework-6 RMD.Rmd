## Tree-Based Models

For this assignment, we will continue working with the file `"pokemon.csv"`, found in `/data`. The file is from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon>.

The [Pokémon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) franchise encompasses video games, TV shows, movies, books, and a card game. This data set was drawn from the video game series and contains statistics about 721 Pokémon, or "pocket monsters." In Pokémon games, the user plays as a trainer who collects, trades, and battles Pokémon to (a) collect all the Pokémon and (b) become the champion Pokémon trainer.

Each Pokémon has a [primary type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type) (some even have secondary types). Based on their type, a Pokémon is strong against some types, and vulnerable to others. (Think rock, paper, scissors.) A Fire-type Pokémon, for example, is vulnerable to Water-type Pokémon, but strong against Grass-type.

The goal of this assignment is to build a statistical learning model that can predict the **primary type** of a Pokémon based on its generation, legendary status, and six battle statistics.

**Note: Fitting ensemble tree-based models can take a little while to run. Consider running your models outside of the .Rmd, storing the results, and loading them in your .Rmd to minimize time to knit.**

### Exercise 1

Read in the data and set things up as in Homework 5:

- Use `clean_names()`
- Filter out the rarer Pokémon types
- Convert `type_1` and `legendary` to factors

```{r}
#install.packages("vip")

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(corrplot)

setwd("/Users/abhayzope/Desktop/Pstat 131")
Pokemon_data=read.csv("Pokemon.csv")
Pokemon_data %>%
 head()
```

```{r}
#install.packages("janitor")
 library(janitor)
new_Pokemon <-Pokemon_data %>% 
   clean_names()

new_Pokemon <- new_Pokemon  %>% filter(type_1 == "Bug" | type_1 == "Grass" | type_1 == "Fire" |  type_1 == "Normal" | type_1 == "Water" | type_1 == "Psychic")

 new_Pokemon$type_1 <- as.factor(new_Pokemon$type_1)
  new_Pokemon$legendary <- as.factor(new_Pokemon$legendary)
  new_Pokemon$generation <- as.factor(new_Pokemon$generation)
new_Pokemon
```

Do an initial split of the data; you can choose the percentage for splitting. Stratify on the outcome variable.

```{r}
set.seed(3435)

Pokemon_split <- initial_split(new_Pokemon, prop = 0.80,
                                strata = type_1)
Pokemon_train <- training(Pokemon_split)
Pokemon_test <- testing(Pokemon_split)

dim(Pokemon_train)
dim(Pokemon_test)
```

Fold the training set using *v*-fold cross-validation, with `v = 5`. Stratify on the outcome variable.

```{r}
Pokemon_folds <- vfold_cv(Pokemon_train, v = 5, strata = type_1)
Pokemon_folds
```

Set up a recipe to predict `type_1` with `legendary`, `generation`, `sp_atk`, `attack`, `speed`, `defense`, `hp`, and `sp_def`:

- Dummy-code `legendary` and `generation`;
- Center and scale all predictors.

```{r}
Pokemon_recipe <- recipe(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed
                            + defense + hp + sp_def, data = Pokemon_train) %>%
  step_dummy(legendary) %>%
  step_dummy(generation) %>%
step_normalize(all_predictors())
```

### Exercise 2

Create a correlation matrix of the training set, using the `corrplot` package. *Note: You can choose how to handle the continuous variables for this plot; justify your decision(s).*

What relationships, if any, do you notice? Do these relationships make sense to you?

```{r, results='hide'}
#Create correlation matrix 

cor_Pokemon <- new_Pokemon %>%
  select(-type_1)  %>%
  select(-type_2) %>%
  select(-name) %>%
  select(-generation) %>%
  select(-legendary) %>%
  correlate()
rplot(cor_Pokemon)


cor_Pokemon %>%
  stretch() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x, y, fill = r)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label = as.character(fashion(r))))

```

The matrix above indicates a strong relationship between total and attack. This makes sense as attack is a key element of a Pokemon's overall stats (total). Similarly, we also see a relationship between total and sp_atk and sp_def. This also makes sense as both of these variables are factored into a pokemon's overall stats (total). With the exception of these variables, we do not see any large correlations.

### Exercise 3

First, set up a decision tree model and workflow. Tune the `cost_complexity` hyperparameter. Use the same levels we used in Lab 7 -- that is, `range = c(-3, -1)`. Specify that the metric we want to optimize is `roc_auc`. 

```{r}
tree_specify <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart")
class_tree_specify <- tree_specify %>%
  set_mode("classification")
class_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(class_tree_specify %>% set_args(cost_complexity = tune())) %>%
  add_formula(type_1 ~ legendary + generation + sp_atk + attack + speed + defense + hp + sp_def)
```

```{r}
set.seed(3435)
parameter_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-3, -1)), levels = 10)

tune_res <- tune_grid(
  class_tree_wf, 
  resamples = Pokemon_folds, 
  grid = parameter_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)
```


Print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? Does a single decision tree perform better with a smaller or larger complexity penalty?

```{r}
autoplot(tune_res)
```
A single decision tree performs better with a larger cost-complexity parameter. This can be seen with the roc_auc apex in the graph above.

### Exercise 4

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
#collect_metrics(tune_res)
arrange(collect_metrics(tune_res, truth = 'roc_auc'))
```
The best roc_auc of the best-performing pruned decision tree on the folds is .6196830.

### Exercise 5

Using `rpart.plot`, fit and visualize your best-performing pruned decision tree with the *training* set.

```{r}
best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res)

class_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(class_tree_wf, best_complexity)

class_tree_final_fit <- fit(class_tree_final, data = Pokemon_train)
```

```{r}
class_tree_final_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()
```

### Exercise 5

Now set up a random forest model and workflow. Use the `ranger` engine and set `importance = "impurity"`. Tune `mtry`, `trees`, and `min_n`. Using the documentation for `rand_forest()`, explain in your own words what each of these hyperparameters represent.

```{r}
new_model <- 
  rand_forest(
              min_n = tune(),
              mtry = tune(),
              trees = tune(),
              mode = "classification") %>% 
  set_engine("ranger") 

new_workflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(new_model) %>% 
  add_recipe(Pokemon_recipe)
```

Mtry is defined as the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split. Trees is defined as the number of trees to grow. Min_n is defined the minimum number of numeric variables.

Create a regular grid with 8 levels each. You can choose plausible ranges for each hyperparameter. Note that `mtry` should not be smaller than 1 or larger than 8. **Explain why not. What type of model would `mtry = 8` represent?**

```{r}
new_params <- parameters(new_model) %>% 
  update(mtry = mtry(range= c(1, 8)))
new_grid <- grid_regular(new_params, levels = 2)
```

Mtry defines the number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split. A value of 8 means that every variable will be randomly sampled.

### Exercise 6

Specify `roc_auc` as a metric. Tune the model and print an `autoplot()` of the results. What do you observe? What values of the hyperparameters seem to yield the best performance?

```{r}
set.seed(3435)

new_tune <- tune_grid(
  new_workflow, 
  resamples = Pokemon_folds, 
  grid = new_grid, 
  metrics = metric_set(roc_auc)
)

autoplot(new_tune)
```
We see better performances with a higher number of predictors and a lower minimal node size. It seems as if the best performance is with a node size of 2 and 8 randomly selected predictors.

### Exercise 7

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing random forest model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
arrange(collect_metrics(new_tune, truth = 'roc_auc'))
```

The best roc_auc here is .7312517.

### Exercise 8

Create a variable importance plot, using `vip()`, with your best-performing random forest model fit on the *training* set.

```{r}

```

Which variables were most useful? Which were least useful? Are these results what you expected, or not?

### Exercise 9

Finally, set up a boosted tree model and workflow. Use the `xgboost` engine. Tune `trees`. Create a regular grid with 10 levels; let `trees` range from 10 to 2000. Specify `roc_auc` and again print an `autoplot()` of the results. 

```{r}
boosted_specification <- boost_tree(trees = tune(), tree_depth = 4) %>%
  set_engine("xgboost") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

boosted_workflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(boosted_specification) %>% 
  add_recipe(Pokemon_recipe)

boosted_parameters <- parameters(boosted_specification) %>% 
  update(trees = trees(range= c(10, 2000)),
         )
boosted_grid <- grid_regular(boosted_parameters, levels = 2)

boosted_tune <- boosted_workflow %>% 
  tune_grid(
    resamples = Pokemon_folds, 
    grid = boosted_grid
    )

autoplot(boosted_tune)
```

What do you observe?

Here we observe that both the roc_auc and the accuracy significantly increase when we utilize more trees.

What is the `roc_auc` of your best-performing boosted tree model on the folds? *Hint: Use `collect_metrics()` and `arrange()`.*

```{r}
arrange(collect_metrics(boosted_tune, truth = 'roc_auc'))
```

The best roc_auc here is .7069904.

### Exercise 10

Display a table of the three ROC AUC values for your best-performing pruned tree, random forest, and boosted tree models. Which performed best on the folds? Select the best of the three and use `select_best()`, `finalize_workflow()`, and `fit()` to fit it to the *testing* set. 

```{r}
select_best(boosted_tune, metric = 'roc_auc')
```

Print the AUC value of your best-performing model on the testing set. Print the ROC curves. Finally, create and visualize a confusion matrix heat map.

Which classes was your model most accurate at predicting? Which was it worst at?

### Exercise 11

Using the `abalone.txt` data from previous assignments, fit and tune a random forest model to predict `age`. Use stratified cross-validation and select ranges for `mtry`, `min_n`, and `trees`. Present your results. What was the model's RMSE on your testing set?
